# What is this?
This is a place that I like to store templates for certain rules that I use throughout my Webpack projects. What I've found is that it is very difficult to modularly configure Webpack with just config files, or at least with the way that I was doing and the approach that I had in mind were sub-optimal at best. With the existence of this repository, I'm hoping to create templates for small things like rules by working at a lower level while maintaining the approach of making config templates.

**Do note** - this is not for everybody and it is mostly a personal thing I thought I'd create in order to save time, if this does not align with you then you are welcome to avoid this approach and create your own or stick to better approaches (manually creating configs, using alternative bundlers/frameworks, i.e. Rollup/Next.js).
